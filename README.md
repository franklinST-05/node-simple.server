# CRUD with Node.js
This project demonstrates a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API with Node.js and PostgreSQL. The application was created with the intention of using as few libraries as possible with the help of the ["Jovem Programador"](https://youtu.be/bh0GhOWko8E) channel

# Prerequisites
Before running the project, you need to have the following tools installed on your system:

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL

# Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/franklinST-05/node-simple.server.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd node-simple.server`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn`

# Usage
Start the server: `node src/index.js`
Use the following endpoints to perform CRUD operations:
- `GET /tasks`: retrieve all tasks
- `POST /task`: create a new task
- `PUT /task`: update an existing task
- `DELETE /task`: delete a task
